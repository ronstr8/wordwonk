# Changelog

All notable changes to Wordwonk will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.14.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed (1.14.0)

- **Frontend Architecture Overhaul**: Refactored the monolithic `App.jsx` (~1150 lines) into a modular, hook-based architecture, reducing primary component size by 70%.
- **Custom Hooks Ecosystem**: Introduced specialized hooks (`usePlayerAuth`, `useGameState`, `useGameSocket`, `useGameController`, `useInteractionHandler`) to cleanly separate network I/O, game state, and user interaction logic.
- **Component Decomposition**: Extracted `GameHeader` and `GameArea` into dedicated, reusable components to improve UI maintainability.
- **Backend Configuration Hardening**: Refactored `Wordwonk::Game::StateProcessor` to utilize Moose attributes for scoring rules, enabling dependency injection and decoupling critical game logic from environment variables.
- **Rust Service Modularization**: Extracted state bootstrapping in the `wordd` service into dedicated functions, cleaning up `main.rs` and improving startup orchestration.

### Fixed (1.14.0)

- **Service Robustness**: Replaced panic-prone `unwrap()` calls in the Rust word service with graceful error handling, ensuring informative failures if word lists are missing or misconfigured.
- **Config Syntax**: Hardened `StateProcessor` attribute defaults in Perl to use safer defined-or (`//`) checks.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added (1.13.0)

- **Automated Backups**: Implemented `make backup` and secure `scripts/backup-db.sh` using Kubernetes secrets for dynamic credential fetching.
- **AI Competitive Scoring**: AI opponents now count toward leaderboard eligibility, allowing solo players to progress against the system (controllable via `global.scoreAgainstAI`).
- **Configurable Logic**: Added `global.scoreAgainstAI` toggle to `values.yaml` to switch between relaxed (AI counts) and strict (2 humans required) scoring.

### Fixed (1.13.0)

- **Volume Permissions**: Switched to `busybox:latest` for volume permission init containers to resolve image pull failures in restricted environments.
- **Database Restoration**: Successfully recovered 1,000+ historical game plays and player accounts from legacy SQL backups.
