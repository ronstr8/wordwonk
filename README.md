# wordwank 💥

A fast-paced word game with familiar roots. You can call it any variation of wordw*nk and it will still be wordwank. Even wordsplat. And go ahead and register those domains, you disgusting pathetic people who squat on the piles of others.

Wordwank is a polyglot microservices platform built as an exercise in modern developer environment practices, distributed systems, and agentic coding. It combines Perl, Rust, and Nginx into a seamless, high-performance game universe.

> [!NOTE]
> The latest development version of the game is running at [wordwank.fazigu.org](https://wordwank.fazigu.org). It is sometimes stable, sometimes crashing into the abyss, and often filled with extra annoying bugs. You have been warned.

*Yes, AI wrote a lot of this, and I like that--even emojis and em-dashes. I'm writing these words here, and tweak the code as necessary, but with Antigravity, it's like I have several different coworkers to call upon to get the project done. It's a massive leap forward for productivity. Every hacker is now his own team.*

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before embarking on your descent into the word-void, ensure your host (e.g., Ubuntu) has the following tools installed:

- **Docker**: For building and running containers.
- **Kind**: Our local Kubernetes environment.
- **kubectl**: The command-line interface for our cluster.
- **Helm**: To manage our eldritch charts.
- **hunspell** & **hunspell-tools**: For generating application lexicons with full affix expansion.
- **hunspell-{lang}**: Dictionaries for your desired languages (e.g., `hunspell-en-us`, `hunspell-de-de`, etc.).

### Quick Install (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
# Install core tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io kubectl helm hunspell hunspell-tools hunspell-en-us hunspell-de-de hunspell-es hunspell-fr hunspell-ru

# Install Kind
# See https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation for latest
go install sigs.k8s.io/kind@latest
# or via binary release:
# curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/latest/kind-linux-amd64 && chmod +x ./kind && sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Initialize the Universe

Before deploying, ensure you have a running Kubernetes cluster and a local Docker registry.

We manage the local environment in a separate repository: **k8s-homelab**.
You can start the cluster from that repository:

```bash
# In the k8s-homelab directory
make up
```

This single command:
- Starts a local Docker registry on `localhost:5000`
- Creates a Kind cluster (default: `homelab`) with ports 80/443 mapped to your host
- Connects the registry to the Kind network
- Deploys the nginx ingress controller

### 2. Build & Deploy

Build all polyglot services, push them to the local registry, and deploy the umbrella Helm chart:

```bash
make build && make deploy && watch kubectl -n wordwank get pods
```

**Persistent Storage**: PostgreSQL uses Kind's built-in `local-path` provisioner via the `standard` StorageClass. Data survives pod restarts and helm upgrades but is scoped to the Kind cluster — deleting the cluster (`make down` in k8s-homelab) wipes all data.

To reset the database without destroying the cluster:

```bash
kubectl -n wordwank delete pvc --all
make deploy
```

### 3. Access the Game

With Kind's `extraPortMappings`, the ingress controller binds directly to your host's ports 80 and 443. Add a hosts entry on your client machine:

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 wordwank.fazigu.org" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Then navigate to `http://wordwank.fazigu.org` to play.

### 4. Setup SSL Certificates (Optional)

For production or if you want trusted HTTPS locally, apply the Let's Encrypt ClusterIssuer:

```bash
# Install cert-manager
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.14.2/cert-manager.yaml

# Wait for it
kubectl wait --namespace cert-manager --for=condition=ready pod --selector=app.kubernetes.io/instance=cert-manager --timeout=180s

# Apply the issuers
kubectl apply -f helm/resources/production/letsencrypt-issuer.yaml
```

*Note: Your domain must be publicly accessible on port 80 for HTTP-01 validation to succeed.*

### 5. External Services Setup

Wordwank integrates with several external services for authentication, notifications, and payments. Follow these steps to generate the required credentials:

#### 🔑 Google OAuth

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Configure the **OAuth consent screen**.
4. Create **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** (Web application).
5. Add `https://wordwank.fazigu.org/auth/google/callback` to the **Authorized redirect URIs**.
6. Copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to `helm/secrets.yaml`.

#### 🎮 Discord OAuth & Webhooks

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create a new Application.
3. Under **OAuth2 -> General**, add `https://wordwank.fazigu.org/auth/discord/callback` to the **Redirects**.
4. In the **OAuth2 -> URL Generator**, select the following scopes:
   - `identify`
   - `email`
5. Copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to `helm/secrets.yaml`.
6. To enable **Notifications**:
   - In your Discord server, go to a channel's settings -> **Integrations** -> **Webhooks**.
   - Create a new webhook and copy the **Webhook URL** to `helm/secrets.yaml` under `admin-discord-webhook`.

#### ☕ Ko-fi Donations

1. Go to your [Ko-fi Dashboard](https://ko-fi.com/manage/index).
2. Note your **Ko-fi Page ID** (e.g., if your link is `ko-fi.com/wordwank`, your ID is `wordwank`).
3. Set `VITE_KOFI_ID` in your frontend `.env` file or environment variables.

### 6. PLAYTIME

Navigate to `https://wordwank.fazigu.org` (or `http://` if you skipped SSL setup) to begin.

*My heathen prayers reach out to you, hoping that it works the first time. It took me so long to get comfortable with hooking my development environment up to the outside world in a way that didn't seem hacky and better mirrored the production environment, but I think this finally gets it right. Over the five years at my last job, nobody there seemed to care or wanted to brainstorm/troubleshoot the issue. I wish I'd had Antigravity back then.*

### 7. Lexicons

Wordwank uses high-speed, pre-compiled lexicons for word validation. If you want to update the word lists from the latest Hunspell dictionaries:

```bash
# Standard rebuild of all lexicons
# This requires hunspell and hunspell-tools (unmunch) to be installed.
make lexicons
```

You can customize the source and destination paths if your system stores dictionaries elsewhere:

```bash
make lexicons HUNSPELL_DICTS=/path/to/dicts WORDD_ROOT=srv/wordd/share/words
```

### 8. Teardown

To destroy the Kind cluster and local registry, run this command in the **k8s-homelab** repository:

```bash
# In the k8s-homelab directory
make down
```

## 📐 Architecture

- **frontend**: React-based UI (Vite/Nginx).
- **backend**: Perl (Mojolicious) service handling authentication, API, and WebSocket.
- **wordd**: Rust-based high-speed word validator.
